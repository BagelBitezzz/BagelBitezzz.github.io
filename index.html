  <h1>A little about me!</h1>
  <hr class="noice">
   <p>I am a 17 year old college student who graduated from highschool early because of the Pandemic.
   </p>
   <p>
     One of my main interested is in technology, from things like programming, game development, to computer building, to anything to do with a computer in general.
   </p>
   <p>
     A goal for me would be to go on to be a fairly successful web developer, and to have that be my job and to love doing it like a hobby!
